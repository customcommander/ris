      "The zeroth, first, and second spectral moments of the rototranslational\ncollision-induced absorption (RT CIA) spectra of hydrogen-helium\nmixtures are calculated from the fundamental theory, for temperatures\nfrom 40 to 3000 K. With the help of simple analytical functions of three\nparameters and the information given, the RT CIA spectra of H2-He pairs\ncan be generated on computers of small capacity, with rms deviations\nfrom exact quantum profiles of not more than a few percent. Such\nrepresentations of the CIA spectra are of interest for work related to\nthe atmospheres of the outer planets and cool stars. The theoretical\nspectra are in close agreement with existing laboratory measurements at\nvarious temperatures from about 77 to 3000 K."
